```
[+] 1.  Arrays | status: PENDING
        A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.      
        [+] Static Arrays | PENDING
        [ ] Dynamic Arrays | PENDING

[ ] 2.  Linked Lists | status: PENDING  
        A linear data structure made up of nodes that hold a value and a reference to the next 
        node in the list.
        
[ ] 3.  Stacks | status: PENDING  
        A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
        
[ ] 4.  Queues | status: PENDING  
        A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
        
[ ] 5.  Trees | status: PENDING  
        A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a single node 
        called the root and no cycles.
        
[ ] 6.  Graphs | status: PENDING 
        A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges that may or
        may not have a direction.

[ ] 7.  Hash Tables | status: PENDING 
        A data structure that stores data in an associative manner, using a hash function to map
        keys to values.
        
[ ] 8.  Heaps | status: PENDING 
        A complete binary tree in which every node has a value less than or equal to (or greater
        than or equal to) the values of its children.
        
[ ] 9.  Tries | status: PENDING  
        A tree-like data structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are strings.
        
[ ] 10. Sets | status: PENDING  
        A collection of unique elements.
    
[ ] 11. Maps | status: PENDING 
        A collection of key-value pairs.
        
[ ] 12. Vectors | status: PENDING   
        A dynamic array that can resize itself during runtime.

[ ] 13. Matrices | status: PENDING
        A collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.
        
[ ] 14. Strings | status: PENDING
        A sequence of characters.
        
[ ] 15. Priority Queues | status: PENDING
        A data structure in which each element has a priority associated with it.
        
[ ] 16. Bit Arrays | status: PENDING
        A compact data structure used to represent a sequence of bits.
        
[ ] 17. Binary Search Trees | status: PENDING
        Binary search trees are data structures that organize data in a hierarchical, sorted manner.

[ ] 18. AVL Trees | status: PENDING
        a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees 
        of any node differ by at most one.
        
[ ] 19. B-Trees | status: PENDING
        a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, 
        sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
        
[ ] 20. Red-Black Trees | status: PENDING 
        A self-balancing binary search tree in which each node is either red or black, with 
        certain properties.
        
 [ ] 21. Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees) | status: PENDING
        A data structure used to efficiently compute and update prefix sums of an array.
        
 [ ] 22. Segment Trees | status: PENDING
