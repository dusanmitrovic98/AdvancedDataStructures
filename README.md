```
[ ] 1.  Arrays | status: PENDING
        A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

[ ] 2.  Linked Lists | status: PENDING   
        A linear data structure made up of nodes that hold a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
 
[ ] 3.  Stacks | status: PENDING  
        A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
  
[ ] 4.  Queues | status: PENDING  
        A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

[ ] 5.  Trees | status: PENDING  
        A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a single node called the root and no cycles.

[ ] 6.  Graphs | status: PENDING 
        A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges that may or may not have a direction.

[ ] 7.  Hash Tables | status: PENDING 
        A data structure that stores data in an associative manner, using a hash function to map keys to values.

[ ] 8.  Heaps | status: PENDING 
        A complete binary tree in which every node has a value less than or equal to (or greater than or equal to) the values of its children.
  
[ ] 9.  Tries | status: PENDING  
        A tree-like data structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are strings.

[ ] 10. Sets | status: PENDING  
        A collection of unique elements.
 
[ ] 11. Maps | status: PENDING 
        A collection of key-value pairs.
 
[ ] 12. Vectors | status: PENDING   
        A dynamic array that can resize itself during runtime.

[ ] 13. Matrices | status: PENDING
        A collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.

[ ] 14. Strings | status: PENDING
        A sequence of characters.

[ ] 15. Priority Queues | status: PENDING
        A data structure in which each element has a priority associated with it.

[ ] 16. Bit Arrays | status: PENDING
        A compact data structure used to represent a sequence of bits.

[ ] 17. Binary Search Trees | status: PENDING
        a binary tree in which every node has at most two children, with the left 
        child being less than the parent and the right child being greater than the parent.

[ ] 18. AVL Trees | status: PENDING

[ ] 19. B-Trees | status: PENDING

[ ] 20. Red-Black Trees | status: PENDING
