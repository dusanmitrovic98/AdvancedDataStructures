[ ] 14. Strings | status: PENDING
        A sequence of characters.

[ ] 15. Priority Queues | status: PENDING
        A data structure in which each element has a priority associated with it.

[ ] 16. Bit Arrays | status: PENDING
        A compact data structure used to represent a sequence of bits.

[ ] 17. Binary Search Trees | status: PENDING
        Binary search trees are data structures that organize data in a hierarchical, sorted manner.

[ ] 18. AVL Trees | status: PENDING
        a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees
        of any node differ by at most one.

[ ] 19. B-Trees | status: PENDING
        a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches,
        sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

[ ] 20. Red-Black Trees | status: PENDING
        A self-balancing binary search tree in which each node is either red or black, with
        certain properties.

 [ ] 21. Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees) | status: PENDING
        A data structure used to efficiently compute and update prefix sums of an array.

 [ ] 22. Segment Trees | status: PENDING
         A tree data structure used to perform range queries and updates over an array.

 [ ] 23. Disjoint Sets (Union-Find) | status: PENDING
         A data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports two
         operations: union and find.

 [ ] 24. Bloom Filters | status: PENDING
         a probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

 [ ] 25. Skip Lists | status: PENDING
         A data structure that allows efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations
         on a list of items.

 [ ] 26. Radix Trees | status: PENDING
         A compact trie-like data structure used for indexing variable-length keys.

 [ ] 27. Splay Trees | status: PENDING
         A self-adjusting binary search tree that reorganizes itself after every operation to
         make frequently accessed elements faster to access.

 [ ] 28. Quad Trees | status: PENDING
         A tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children.

 [ ] 29. Octrees | status: PENDING
         A tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children.

 [ ] 30. K-D Trees | status: PENDING
         A space-partitioning data structure used for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.

 [ ] 31. Trie Trees | status: PENDING
         A tree-like data structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are sequences,
         usually strings of characters.

 [ ] 32. Patricia Tries | status: PENDING
         A compressed trie data structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are strings.

 [ ] 33. Fibonacci Heaps | status: PENDING

        binary heap.

[ ] 34. Binomial Heaps | status: PENDING
        A heap data structure where each node has at most two children and the heap shape is
        maintained using a binary encoding of the heap size.

        queries on overlapping intervals.

[ ] 37. B+ Trees | status: PENDING
        A tree data structure used for storing and retrieving large amounts of data on disk or
        other secondary storage devices.

[ ] 38. Range Trees | status: PENDING
        A tree data structure used for range searching, which is the task of finding all points
        or elements in a given range.

[ ] 39. Rope Data Structures | status: PENDING
        A data structure used for efficiently representing and manipulating large strings by
        dividing them into smaller chunks.

[ ] 40. Self-balancing Binary Search Trees | status: PENDING
